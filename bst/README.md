# Binary Search Trees

This directory contains a binary search tree (BST) implementation along with implemented tests.

### BST Description
A BST is a node-based data-structure that has three properties:
    1. The left sub-tree of a node conatins only nodes that are smaller in value than the original
    node.
    2. The right sub-tree of a node contains only nodes that are larger in value than the original
    node.
    3. The left and right sub-trees are also BSTs.

### BST Example
The following is an ASCII representation of a height-balanced BST using the numerical list
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
```
           4
        /      \
      2          6
    /   \      /   \
   1     3    5     7
```
